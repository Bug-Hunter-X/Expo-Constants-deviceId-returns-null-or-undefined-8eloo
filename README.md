# Expo Constants.deviceId Returns Null or Undefined

This repository demonstrates a bug where `Constants.deviceId` in the Expo SDK returns `null` or `undefined` under certain conditions. This issue can lead to unexpected behavior in applications relying on unique device identification.

## Problem
The `Constants.deviceId` method, intended to provide a unique identifier for a device, sometimes returns `null` or `undefined`. This inconsistency occurs particularly in development environments (Expo Go and simulators) and can cause problems with functionalities dependent on device-specific identifiers.

## Solution
The solution involves implementing a fallback mechanism to handle the cases where `Constants.deviceId` returns null or undefined. This is typically achieved by generating a local UUID (Universally Unique Identifier) when `Constants.deviceId` is unavailable and storing this UUID for future use.  Additional checks are needed to ensure the app's ability to function in the event of the identifier being missing or null.

## Setup
Clone this repository and run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies. You can then run the app using `expo start`.
