This bug occurs when using the Expo SDK's `Constants.deviceId` to identify a device.  In certain situations, particularly when the app is running in the Expo Go client or on a simulator, the returned `deviceId` might be null or undefined, causing unexpected behavior in your application. This can lead to issues with features that depend on unique device identification, such as user authentication or data synchronization.
